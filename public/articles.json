    "answer": [
      "The Context API is a component structure provided by the React framework, which enables us to share specific forms of data across all levels of the application. Itâ€™s aimed at solving the problem of prop drilling.",

      "Prop drilling is basically a situation when the same data is being sent at almost every level due to requirements in the final level.",

      "A context contains references to variables and notifies its consumers when these references are changed. We create context container with React.createContext(). The context object exposes with a provider that has a prop named 'value'. We generally consume that with 'useContext' hook."

    "answer": [
      "HTML Semantic tags introduce meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. A semantic tag clearly describes its meaning to both browser and developer. Semantic tags have many advantages over non-semantic tags like semantic tags are of great help to screen readers and they also help in code optimization. An example of semantic elements are \"form\", \"main\" \"article\" and \"nav\"."

    "question": "What is the difference between inline, inline-block and block elements?",
    "answer": [
      "inline: An inline element is as the name implies inline with other elements. It only takes up as much space as it needs. However you can't set a height or a width for an inline element - it will just be ignored.",

      "inline-block: inline-block elements are very similar to inline elements, so they also just take up as much space as they need and elements can be to their left and right because they are 'inline'. In contrast to inline elements you can set a height and a width.",

      "block: Block elements by default take up as much horizontal space as they can get and by that they force a line break after them."
