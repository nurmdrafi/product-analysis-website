    "answer": [
      "The Context API of React, which is a built-in API introduced in React 16.3, is a solution to provide global variable or state in the whole React App. Without Context API, generally we pass the state to 'props drilling' or passing props from grandparent to child to parent, and if we have a lots of component, then it's very annoying and time spending task.",

      "A context contains references to variables and notifies its consumers when these references are changed. We create context container with React.createContext(). The context object exposes with a provider that has a prop named 'value'. We generally consume that with 'useContext' hook."
